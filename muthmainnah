flip flop
A basic digital electrical circuit used in sequential and digital logic systems is the flip-flop.
Being a bistable multivibrator, it can store a single bit of information and has two stable states.
Digital circuits frequently employ flip-flops for data storage and transport. Although there are many varieties of flip-flops, the following are the most popular ones:
SR Flip-Flop (Set-Reset Flip-Flop).
D Flip-Flop (Data or Delay Flip-Flop).
JK Flip-Flop: The JK flip-flop has three inputs.
T Flip-Flop (Toggle Flip-Flop).
